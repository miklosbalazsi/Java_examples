What is Lombok 
---
"Boilerplate" is a term used to describe code that is repeated in many parts of an application with little alteration. 
One of the most frequently voiced criticisms of the Java language is the volume of this type of code that is found in most projects. 
This problem is frequently a result of design decisions in various libraries, but is exacerbated by limitations in the language itself. 
Project Lombok aims to reduce the prevalence of some of the worst offenders by replacing them with a simple set of annotations.


The way it works is by plugging into your build process and autogenerating Java bytecode into your .class files as per a 
number of project annotations you introduce in your code.
